Short benchmarks so far experimenting with cilk-spawn,cilk-for, reducers, and data races within the programming language of Cilk. 

cilk_ss.sh is a script to run read2csv.py on a bunch of output.
pthreads_ss.sh is a script to run read2csv.py on a bunch of output.

read2csv.py is a python script to format the data and upload data into a spreadsheet.
