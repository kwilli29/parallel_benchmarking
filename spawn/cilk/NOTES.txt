TODO:

- run all tests in a script or something, see if they work
- format so it makes data collection easy
- apply to other languages

- make 01A_spawntime_after_sequential.c (Cilk) use ctimer / clockgettime
- same with 01B_spawntime_after_cilkscope.c (Cilk)
- probably will need to make this adjustment for literally all cilk files, at LEAST
